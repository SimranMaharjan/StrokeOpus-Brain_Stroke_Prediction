ðŸ§  StrokeOpus: Brain Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning
This is a full-stack web application for predicting the likelihood of a brain stroke using a Random Forest classifier. The machine learning model was trained on a Kaggle stroke dataset containing patient health and lifestyle features. The model is integrated into a Flask backend, while the frontend is developed using React.

The application accepts user input through the React UI, applies one-hot encoding to categorical variables, and forwards the processed data to the backend where it is passed into a pre-trained model serialized using Pickle. The output is a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of stroke risk.
